# Advanced Counting Techniques

Example: How many bit string of length $n$ do not contain two consecutive zeros?

To solve this problem, let $a_n$ be the number of such strings of length $n$. An argument can be given that show that the sequence $\{a_n\}$ satisifies the recurrence relation $a_{n+1}=a_n+a_{n-1}$ and the initial condition $a_1=2$ and $a_2 = 3$.

## Review of the definition of recurrence relation

A recurrence relation for a sequence $\{a_n\}$ is an equation that expresses $a_n$ in terms of one or more previous elements of the sequence, for all $n \ge n_0$.

A particular sequence, described non-recurisely, is said to solve the given recurrence relation if it is consistent with the definition of the recurence.

> A given recurrence relation may have many solutions.

### Some Examples

#### The Tower of Hanoi

Let $H_n$ represent the number of moves for a stack of $n$ disks.

And we will have such a strategy:

* Move the top $n-1$ disks to spare peg, which is $H_{n-1}$​
* Move the bottom disk, 1
* Move the top $n-1$ disks to target reg, alos $H_{n-1}$​

So we will have $H_n=2 H_{n-1} + 1$  

And $H_n = 2^n - 1$.

#### The Number of Bit String

Find a recurence relation and give initial conditions for the number of bits strings of length $n$ that do not have two consecutive 0s. How many such bit strings are there of length five?

Let $a_n$ denote the number of bit strings of lenght $n$;

$a_1=2$,as 0 and 1;

$a_2=3$, as 01, 10 and 11;

and we have the two ways to construct the $a_n$ bit string, add $1$ to $a_{n-1}$ and add $10$ to $a_{n-2}$, so we get the recurrence realtion $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$.

#### Catalan Numbers

Find a recurrence relation for $C_n$, the number of ways to parenthesize the product of $n+1$ numbers $x_0, x_1, x_2,x_3,\cdots, x_n$ to specify the order of multiplication. For example $C_3=5$ since there are five ways to parenthesize $x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3$ to determine the order of multiplication: $((x_0*x_1)*x_2)*x_3$, $(x_0*(x_1*x_2)*x_3)$,$(x_0*x_1)*(x_2*x_3)$, $x_0*((x_1*x_2)*x_3)$, $x_0*(x_1*(x_2*x_3))$.

$$
\begin{align}
C_n&=C_0C_{n_1}+C_1C_{n-2}+\cdots+C_{n-1}C_0\nonumber\\
&=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_kC_{n-k-1}\nonumber
\end{align}
$$

## Solving Recurrences

A linear homogeneous recurrence of degree $k$ wih constant coefficients , a.k.a k-LiHoReCoCo, is a recurence of the form

$$
a_n=c_1a_{n-1} + \cdots + c_k a_{n-k}
$$

where the $c_i$ are all real and $c_k \not = 0$.

The solution is uniquely determined if $k$ initial conitions are provided.

### Solving LiHoReCoCos

Basic idea: look for solutions of the form $a_n=r^n$, where $r$ is a constant.

This requires the characterisitic equation:

$$
r^n=c_1r^{n-1}+\cdots+ c_kr^{n-k} \\
r^k-c_1r^{k-1}-c_{k-1}r-c_k=0
$$

The solutions, called as characteristic roots,  can yield an explicit formula for the sequence.

Consider an arbitary 2-LiHoReCoCos:

$$
a_n=c_1a_{n-1}+c_2a_{n-2}
$$

It has the characteristic equation:

$$
r^2-c_1r-c_2=0
$$

#### Theorem 1

If this CE has 2 roots $r_1 \not =r_2$, then $a_n=\alpha_1r_1^n+\alpha_2r_2^n$ for $n \ge 0$ for some constants $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$.

#### Theorem 2

If this CE has only 1 root $r_0$, then $a_n=\alpha_1r_0^n+\alpha_2nr_0^n$, for all $n \ge 0$, for some constants $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$.

## Generating Functions

The generating function for the sequence $\{a_n\}$ is the infinite power series

$$
G(x)=a_0+a_1x+\cdots+a_nx^n+\dots\\
= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_kx^k
$$

### Theroem 1

Let $f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^na_kx^k$ and $g(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}b_kx^k$, and we have:

* $f(x)+g(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n(a_k+b_k)x^k$
* $f(x)g(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n(\sum_{j=0}^ka_jb_{k-j})x^k$

#### Extended Binomail Theroem

Let $x \in R$ and let $u \in R$, then 

$$
(1+x)^u=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(_k^n)x^k
$$

As we have two theroems about generating functions, we give a list of some generating functions:
