# Tree

## Introduction of Tree

### Defination of Tree

A **tree** is a connected undirected graph with no simple circuits.

An undirected graph without simple circuits is called a **forest**​.

### Rooted Tree

A **rooted tree** is a tree in which one node has been designed the root. There are some terms related to rooted tree:

* Parent
* child
* silibings
* ancestors
* descentents
* leaf
* internal node
* subtree
