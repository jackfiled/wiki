We will focus on security and cryptography concepts that are relevant in understanding tools covered earlier in this class, such as the use of hash functions in Git or key derivation functions and symmetric/asymmetric cryptosystems in SSH. This lecture has a very informal (but we think practical) treatment of basic cryptography concepts.

## Entropy

> entropy 熵;

[Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) is a measure of randomness. This is useful, for example, when determining the strength of a password.

Entropy is measured in *bits*, and when selecting uniformly at random from a set of possible outcomes, the entropy is equal to `log_2(# of possibilities)`. A fair coin flip gives 1 bit of entropy. A dice roll (of a 6-sided die) has ~2.58 bits of entropy.

You should consider that the attacker knows the *model* of the password, but not the randomness (e.g. from [dice rolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware)) used to select a particular password.

> dice rolls 骰子;

How many bits of entropy is enough? It depends on your threat model. For online guessing, ~40 bits of entropy is pretty good. To be resistant to offline guessing, a stronger password would be necessary (e.g. 80 bits, or more).

## Hash functions

A [cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed size, and has some special properties. A rough specification of a hash function is as follows:

```
hash(value: array<byte>) -> vector<byte, N>  (for some fixed N)
```

An example of a hash function is [SHA1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1), which is used in Git. It maps arbitrary-sized inputs to 160-bit outputs (which can be represented as 40 hexadecimal characters). We can try out the SHA1 hash on an input using the `sha1sum` command:

```bash
➜  ~ echo 'hello' | sha1sum
f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f  -
➜  ~ echo 'hello' | sha1sum
f572d396fae9206628714fb2ce00f72e94f2258f  -
➜  ~ echo 'Hello' | sha1sum
1d229271928d3f9e2bb0375bd6ce5db6c6d348d9
```

At a high level, a hash function can be thought of as a hard-to-invert random-looking (but deterministic) function. A hash function has the following properties:

- Deterministic: the same input always generates the same output.
- Non-invertible: it is hard to find an input `m` such that `hash(m) = h` for some desired output `h`.
- Target collision resistant: given an input `m_1`, it’s hard to find a different input `m_2` such that `hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)`.
- Collision resistant: it’s hard to find two inputs `m_1` and `m_2` such that `hash(m_1) = hash(m_2)` (note that this is a strictly stronger property than target collision resistance).

Note: while it may work for certain purposes, SHA-1 is [no longer](https://shattered.io/) considered a strong cryptographic hash function. You might find this table of [lifetimes of cryptographic hash functions](https://valerieaurora.org/hash.html) interesting.

### Application

- Git, for content-addressed storage. The idea of a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) is a more general concept (there are non-cryptographic hash functions).
- A short summary of the contents of a file. Software can often be downloaded from (potentially less trustworthy) mirrors, e.g. Linux ISOs, and it would be nice to not have to trust them. The official sites usually post hashes alongside the download links (that point to third-party mirrors), so that the hash can be checked after downloading a file.
- [Commitment schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_scheme). Suppose you want to commit to a particular value, but reveal the value itself later. For example, I want to do a fair coin toss “in my head”, without a trusted shared coin that two parties can see. I could choose a value `r = random()`, and then share `h = sha256(r)`. Then, you could call heads or tails (we’ll agree that even `r` means heads, and odd `r` means tails). After you call, I can reveal my value `r`, and you can confirm that I haven’t cheated by checking `sha256(r)` matches the hash I shared earlier.

## Key derivation functions

> derivation 推导;

> 中文译名为密钥导出函数。

A related concept to cryptographic hashes, [key derivation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) (KDFs) are used for a number of applications, including producing fixed-length output for use as keys in other cryptographic algorithms. Usually, KDFs are deliberately slow, in order to slow down offline brute-force attacks.

> 故意降低速度真的有用吗?

### Application

- Producing keys from passphrases for use in other cryptographic algorithms (e.g. symmetric cryptography, see below).
- Storing login credentials. Storing plaintext passwords is bad; the right approach is to generate and store a random [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)) `salt = random()` for each user, store `KDF(password + salt)`, and verify login attempts by re-computing the KDF given the entered password and the stored salt.

## Symmetric cryptography

> symmetric 对称的;

Hiding message contents is probably the first concept you think about when you think about cryptography. Symmetric cryptography accomplishes this with the following set of functionality:

```
keygen() -> key  (this function is randomized)

encrypt(plaintext: array<byte>, key) -> array<byte>  (the ciphertext)
decrypt(ciphertext: array<byte>, key) -> array<byte>  (the plaintext)
```

The encrypt function has the property that given the output (ciphertext), it’s hard to determine the input (plaintext) without the key. The decrypt function has the obvious correctness property, that `decrypt(encrypt(m, k), k) = m`.

An example of a symmetric cryptosystem in wide use today is [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).

### Application

- Encrypting files for storage in an untrusted cloud service. This can be combined with KDFs, so you can encrypt a file with a passphrase. Generate `key = KDF(passphrase)`, and then store `encrypt(file, key)`.

## Asymmetric cryptography

> asymmetric 非对称的;

The term “asymmetric” refers to there being two keys, with two different roles. A private key, as its name implies, is meant to be kept private, while the public key can be publicly shared and it won’t affect security (unlike sharing the key in a symmetric cryptosystem). Asymmetric cryptosystems provide the following set of functionality, to encrypt/decrypt and to sign/verify:

```
keygen() -> (public key, private key)  (this function is randomized)

encrypt(plaintext: array<byte>, public key) -> array<byte>  (the ciphertext)
decrypt(ciphertext: array<byte>, private key) -> array<byte>  (the plaintext)

sign(message: array<byte>, private key) -> array<byte>  (the signature)
verify(message: array<byte>, signature: array<byte>, public key) -> bool  (whether or not the signature is valid)
```

The encrypt/decrypt functions have properties similar to their analogs from symmetric cryptosystems. A message can be encrypted using the *public* key. Given the output (ciphertext), it’s hard to determine the input (plaintext) without the *private* key. The decrypt function has the obvious correctness property, that `decrypt(encrypt(m, public key), private key) = m`.

Symmetric and asymmetric encryption can be compared to physical locks. A symmetric cryptosystem is like a door lock: anyone with the key can lock and unlock it. Asymmetric encryption is like a padlock with a key. You could give the unlocked lock to someone (the public key), they could put a message in a box and then put the lock on, and after that, only you could open the lock because you kept the key (the private key).

The sign/verify functions have the same properties that you would hope physical signatures would have, in that it’s hard to forge a signature. No matter the message, without the *private* key, it’s hard to produce a signature such that `verify(message, signature, public key)` returns true. And of course, the verify function has the obvious correctness property that `verify(message, sign(message, private key), public key) = true`.

### Applications

- [PGP email encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy). People can have their public keys posted online (e.g. in a PGP keyserver, or on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/)). Anyone can send them encrypted email.
- Private messaging. Apps like [Signal](https://signal.org/) and [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) use asymmetric keys to establish private communication channels.
- Signing software. Git can have GPG-signed commits and tags. With a posted public key, anyone can verify the authenticity of downloaded software.

### Key distribution

Asymmetric-key cryptography is wonderful, but it has a big challenge of distributing public keys / mapping public keys to real-world identities. There are many solutions to this problem. Signal has one simple solution: trust on first use, and support out-of-band public key exchange (you verify your friends’ “safety numbers” in person). PGP has a different solution, which is [web of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust). Keybase has yet another solution of [social proof](https://keybase.io/blog/chat-apps-softer-than-tofu) (along with other neat ideas).

## Case stduies

### Password managers

This is an essential tool that everyone should try to use (e.g. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/), [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), and [1Password](https://1password.com/)). Password managers make it convenient to use unique, randomly generated high-entropy passwords for all your logins, and they save all your passwords in one place, encrypted with a symmetric cipher with a key produced from a passphrase using a KDF.

Using a password manager lets you avoid password reuse (so you’re less impacted when websites get compromised), use high-entropy passwords (so you’re less likely to get compromised), and only need to remember a single high-entropy password.

> compromised 被盗的;

### Two-factor authentication

[Two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication) (2FA) requires you to use a passphrase (“something you know”) along with a 2FA authenticator (like a [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/), “something you have”) in order to protect against stolen passwords and [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) attacks.

### Full disk encryption

Keeping your laptop’s entire disk encrypted is an easy way to protect your data in the case that your laptop is stolen. You can use [cryptsetup + LUKS](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dm-crypt/Encrypting_a_non-root_file_system) on Linux, [BitLocker](https://fossbytes.com/enable-full-disk-encryption-windows-10/) on Windows, or [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837) on macOS. This encrypts the entire disk with a symmetric cipher, with a key protected by a passphrase.

### Private messaging

Use [Signal](https://signal.org/) or [Keybase](https://keybase.io/). End-to-end security is bootstrapped from asymmetric-key encryption. Obtaining your contacts’ public keys is the critical step here. If you want good security, you need to authenticate public keys out-of-band (with Signal or Keybase), or trust social proofs (with Keybase).

### SSH

When you run `ssh-keygen`, it generates an asymmetric keypair, `public_key, private_key`. This is generated randomly, using entropy provided by the operating system (collected from hardware events, etc.). The public key is stored as-is (it’s public, so keeping it a secret is not important), but at rest, the private key should be encrypted on disk. The `ssh-keygen` program prompts the user for a passphrase, and this is fed through a key derivation function to produce a key, which is then used to encrypt the private key with a symmetric cipher.

> 不过我们貌似在ssh-keygen时，都是把passphrase留空的。

In use, once the server knows the client’s public key (stored in the `.ssh/authorized_keys` file), a connecting client can prove its identity using asymmetric signatures. This is done through [challenge-response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge–response_authentication). At a high level, the server picks a random number and sends it to the client. The client then signs this message and sends the signature back to the server, which checks the signature against the public key on record. This effectively proves that the client is in possession of the private key corresponding to the public key that’s in the server’s `.ssh/authorized_keys` file, so the server can allow the client to log in.
